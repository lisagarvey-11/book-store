              <p>This famous independent bookstore was founded by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Beach">Sylvia Beach</a> (1887 - 1962) in November 1919 in Paris, France. In 1941, Ms. Beach closed the bookstore in an effort to save it from being destroyed by the Germans in WWII. Ms. Beach was sent to an internment camp after she refused to sell the Germans a book. Another bookstore was re-named Shakespeare and Company in her honor in 1964 on the 400th Anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. People come from all over the world to experience the atmosphere and take a step back in time.

              <p>A professor at the University of Paris and the founder (along with her husband) of the Curie Institute, Madame Curie won two Nobel Peace prizes for her pioneering research in radiation. Because of this work, she was able to add two new elements to the periodic table. Madam Curie is interned at the Pantheon, Paris not too far from the bookstore and the University of Paris.</p>

              <p>Some famous Curie quotes include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><i>I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy.</i></li>
                <li><i>In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons.</i></li>
                <li><i>I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries.</i></li>
